 Project Instructions
 
- [X] Create or find an image file to represent yourself and a new image for the background. Be aware of file size: keep the profile image under 400 KB and the background image under 1 MB (see the link in the project resources section to Picresize, an online image resizing tool).

- [X] Using a text editor, modify the HTML of the index.html file:
* Add the images you collected in step 1 to the page. Please leave the class "profile-image" intact on your profile image.
* Don't forget to update the text for your new profile image's alt attribute!

- [X] Personalize all the text on the page by changing the name, background and goals. Feel free to make up the information if you do not wish to share anything personal.

- [X] Add links to your GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. If you don't have a Twitter or LinkedIn account, or don't want to share those, then you need to delete those links.

- [X] Edit the href value of the Home link so it navigates to index.html. Note: do not use root relative links, or links that begin with a leading forward slash, /.

- [X] Create an additional page to expand on the online profile
* Create a second html file. Name the file experience.html or something similar, such as resume.html. Change the href value of the Experience link in index.html to point to this 			 new file.
* Add HTML and text content to the additional page. Base your design and HTML on the index.html file or create your own HTML.
* Edit the href value of the "Experience" link to navigate to your new page.
* Feel free to change the name of the page ("Interests", for example), just make sure that you update the links to match the name of the page.
* You can write custom CSS for the new page, as long as you use style.css for both pages.
